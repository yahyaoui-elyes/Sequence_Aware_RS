# Sequence_Aware_RS

## General Context
Infor EzRMS helps hotels optimize revenue by automatically forecasting demand and
recommending appropriate sales strategies based on pre-defined criteria and dynamic
algorithms. EzRMS generates recommendations regarding prices, schedules, and associated
offers for each hotel. Smoothly presenting such number of features has its own
challenges and the user can spend a lot of time exploring the interface rather than efficiently
using it. This is especially the case for new users that did not receive any prior
training or haven’t read the user manual guide. Due to the complexity of the interface,
EzRMS is not used at its full potential and with other competitor products launching in
the market a decision to enhance the whole interface and integrate a Recommendation
System (RS) has been made.
The goal is to build a recommendation system that predicts the next-items a user will click on. This system will exploit navigational behavior in order to extract patterns and trends and best-fit the data in order to provide relevant recommendations. This engine will be embedded into Infor EzRMS’ interface and act as tool that simplifies the navigation and enhances the user experience.

## Methodology
This project started by getting deeper insights on the Hospitality industry and the
Revenue Management Systems. Then, we moved on to discovering the solution that
Infor provides and its shortcomings. After that, we proceeded by getting a deeper
understanding of the application domain and shortlisting the features required in order
to overcome the EzRMS’s shortcomings. Afterwards, we moved on to the research and
development phase where we explored and adapted existing solutions related to our
project’s goals and thoughtfully worked to optimize their outcomes.
