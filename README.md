# Sequence_Aware_RS
This project aims to build a recommendation system that predicts the next-items a user will click on. This system will exploit navigational behavior in order to extract patterns and trends and best-fit the data in order to provide relevant recommendations. This engine will be embedded into Infor EzRMSâ€™ interface and act as tool that simplifies the navigation and enhances the user experience.
