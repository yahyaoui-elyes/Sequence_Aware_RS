# Sequence_Aware_RS
This project aims to build a recommendation system that predicts the next-items a user will click on. This system will exploit navigational behavior in order to extract patterns and trends and best-fit the data in order to provide relevant recommendations. This engine will be embedded into Infor EzRMS’ interface and act as tool that simplifies the navigation and enhances the user experience.

## Methodology
This project started by getting deeper insights on the Hospitality industry and the
Revenue Management Systems. Then, we moved on to discovering the solution that
Infor provides and its shortcomings. After that, we proceeded by getting a deeper
understanding of the application domain and shortlisting the features required in order
to overcome the EzRMS’s shortcomings. Afterwards, we moved on to the research and
development phase where we explored and adapted existing solutions related to our
project’s goals and thoughtfully worked to optimize their outcomes.
